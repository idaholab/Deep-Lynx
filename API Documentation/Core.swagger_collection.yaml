  title: Deep Lynx
  description: |-
    The construction of megaprojects has consistently demonstrated challenges for project managers in regard to meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements. Megaproject construction challenges are common place within megaprojects with many active projects in the United States failing to meet cost and schedule efforts by significant margins. Currently, engineering teams operate in siloed tools and disparate teams where connections across design, procurement, and construction systems are translated manually or over brittle point-to-point integrations. The manual nature of data exchange increases the risk of silent errors in the reactor design, with each silent error cascading across the design. These cascading errors lead to uncontrollable risk during construction, resulting in significant delays and cost overruns. Deep Lynx allows for an integrated platform during design and operations of mega projects.

    The Deep Lynx Core API delivers a few main features.

    1. Provides a set of methods and endpoints for manipulating data in an object oriented database. This allows us to store complex datatypes as records and then to compile them into actual, modifiable objects at run-time. Users can store taxonomies or ontologies in a readable format.

    2. Provides methods for storing and retrieving data in a graph database. This data is structured and validated against the aformentioned object oriented database before storage.

  - name: Containers
    description: 'Containers are considered a root object with only users and organizations as potential parents. Containers separate object defintions (as declared in Metatypes) from each other and allow for versioning and access control. '
  - name: Data Query
    description: 'Deep Lynx gives you the ability to query data using a GraphQL enabled endpoint. Please see the documentation on GraphQL and run a schema query to learn more about what search methods, query arguments, and fields are available to you.'
  - name: Graph
    description: 'These endpoints give you the ability to add nodes and edges to the graph manually as well as perform some basic queries. For all advanced queries, please use the GraphQL query endpoint.'
  - name: Metatypes
    description: 'Metatypes only consist of a name and a description. While this might change, the bulk of information about a type should reside in its keys and relationships. Metatypes can be considered as "classes" when referring to web ontology.'
  - name: Metatype Keys
    description: 'Keys represent a Metatype''s properties, and in the future, its methods. This information allows for a user to modify and compile a complex object type/class and store it in a readable format. Inserted data is then validated against a Metatype''s declared keys/properties.'
  - name: Metatype Relationships
    description: Metatype Relationships consist of a name and a description. They define  the relationships available to be instantiated between certain Metatypes  as Metatype Relationship Pairs.
  - name: Metatype Relationship Keys
    description: 'Keys represent a Metatype Relationship''s properties, and in the future, its methods. This information allows for a user to modify and compile a complex object type/class relationship and store it in a readable format. Relationships declared between already inserted data will be verified against its declared Metatype Relationship.'
  - name: Metatype Relationship Pairs
    description: 'Metatype Relationship pairs represent the actual connection between two Metatypes. Properties of that relationship are attached to the Metatype Relationship. Again, this only represents the connection between two Metatypes.'
  - name: Data Sources
    description: 'This set of endpoints allows the user to create and manage data sources. As of 3/26/2020 only the HTTP data source type is supported, and that''s still under construction. Each endpoint functions - but there is no guaranteed functionality with regards to data sources beyond this point.'
  - name: Data Export
    description: 'These endpoints have to do with the export functionality. A snapshot of the contained data can be exported to numerous different data sources. However, only Gremlin enabled Graph databases are supported for export.'
  - name: Users
    description: 'These endpoints have to do with user functionality. As of 3/26/2020 there are no methods for creating new users - other than enabling and use SAML-ADFS authentication methods. Unless using this method, either request/build a feature or use Basic Authentication configuration.'
  - name: Data Type Mappings
    description: These are mappings for taking unknown payloads and mapping them to known data classes and structures prior to storage.
  - name: Imports
    description: These endpoints allow for retrieving or deleting the data associated with  a given import from a Data Source.
  - name: Events
    description: 'An application may create a Registered Event with Deep Lynx in order to  receive messages from Deep Lynx concerning the event type registered. This  system may be used to receive alerts when other Data Sources have ingested data, a new data source is created, etc.'
  - name: Authentication
    description: These endpoints provide users and applications the ability to authenticate with Deep Lynx.
  - name: Tasks

        Creates a new key for a metatype. Keys consist of a unique key name (unique to the metatype only), key type, default values, and allowed values. Of those, only the first two are required.

        The `dataType` field accepts only one of the following values: number, string, date, boolean, enumeration, file. 

        The fields `defaultValue` and `options` will only accept an array of the following types: string, boolean, number, float.

        Pass in an array for bulk creation.

        Currently the validation and cardinality functionality of keys are NOT checked at data insertion.

      summary: Upload File
      description: |-
        Uploads a file and it's metadata to Deep Lynx. All additional fields on the multipart form will be processed and added as metadata to the file upload itself. 

        This should be a collection of files and normal fields. If you include a file field and call that "metadata" - you can include a normal metadata upload as either a json, csv, or xml file. This data will be processed like a normal import and the files attached to the processed data. Once Deep Lynx generates nodes and edges from that data, any files attached will automatically be attached to the resulting nodes/edges as well.

        NOTE: The metadata file you upload, if json, must be wrapped in an array. If you do not pass in an array of objects, even if it's a single object, then Deep Lynx will attempt to split up your metadata into its parts instead of treating it like a whole object.
