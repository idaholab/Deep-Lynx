## What is DeepLynx?

DeepLynx is a open-source data warehouse focused on enabling complex projects to embrace digital engineering. It accomplishes bringing digital thread and digital twins to these projects with integrations to a large collection of software systems across a project's lifecycle.


## Why Embrace Digital Engineering and DeepLynx?

The construction of megaprojects has consistently demonstrated challenges for project managers in regard to meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements.

Currently, engineering teams operate in siloed tools and disparate teams. Data connections across design, procurement, construction, and operations systems are translated manually or over brittle point-to-point integrations.

This uncoordinated and disjoint data exchange across these siloes increases the risk of silent errors. These silent errors can cascade across the effort and lead to uncontrollable risk during construction, resulting in significant delays and cost overruns.

DeepLynx is a key tool in solving this problem for megaprojects by bringing those siloed efforts into an integrated platform that operates over the course of a project's lifecycle. DeepLynx integrates to widely used enterprise scale software. The list of software integrations include tools such as Innoslate for systems engineering, IBM's DOORS for requirements management, design tools such as AutoDesk's Revit, and asset management in ABB's AssetSuite.

Leveraging this rich set of integrations allows for projects to efficiently consolidate their data into a cohesive data lake. This data lake provides the foundation for digital thread and digital twin efforts.
