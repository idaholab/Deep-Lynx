# 0. Use of Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Date: 2024-12-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context
We need the ability to record large architecture decisions, and do it through a forum that allows multiple users to have their voices heard. By using Architecture Decision Records that must be merged through Pull Requests, we are able to maintain not only a history of decisions and why they were made, but also give those working on the project an async way of having their voices heard. We hope we can mimic the RFC methodology adopted by many larger projects, and make sure we're pausing to reflect on requirements before large technical decisions are made.


## Decision(s)
- We will use ADRs to record large architecture decisions or application usage decisions
- ADRs will be able to be created by anyone, but must go through the Pull Request process before they're deemed accepted
- ADRs will typically be open for 4-5 days unless the decision is either more unified that thought, or more devisive than thought.
- When possible, an ADR _must_ be tied directly to functional requirements. 

## Consequences
Architectual changes and decisions, as well as application usage changes and decisiosn will be driven partially through the accepting and rejecting of ADRs
